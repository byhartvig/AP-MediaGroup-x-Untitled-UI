# AP MediaGroup x UntitledUI

I have decided to follow the hype and start using TailwindCSS, but I was lacking some designs. Therefore, I asked for permission to develop some of the prototypes that Jordan Hughes has on his Twitter (link), which were created using the fantastic UI from untitledui.com, and they will all be available in this Repo.



## Features

- Fully responsive
- Build with TailwindCSS
- Build with plain HTML
- Added some Javascript sprinkles at top
